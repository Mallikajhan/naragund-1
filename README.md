$what is cloud computing
    -Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources like servers, storage, and software over the internet, allowing users to access them remotely and pay only for what they use instead of owning and            maintaining their own physical infrastructure. This model provides flexibility, scalability, and cost savings by leveraging large-scale data centers operated by cloud service providers
$ Key aspects of cloud computing:
*On-demand services: Resources like processing power, storage, databases, networking, and software are available as needed through the internet. 
*No physical infrastructure: Companies can access and use these resources without having to buy, own, and maintain their own physical data centers and servers. 
*Pay-as-you-go pricing: Users are typically charged only for the specific services they consume, which can lower operating costs. 
*Scalability: The model allows businesses to scale their IT resources up or down quickly based on changing needs. 
Examples: Services include application development platforms, analytics, and software like customer relationship management (CRM). 

$Common service models:
*Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides access to fundamental computing resources like virtual data centers, processing power, and storage. 
*Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers an environment for developing, running, and managing applications without the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure. 
*Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet, often on a subscription basis, so users can access them through a web browser without needing to install them locally.
